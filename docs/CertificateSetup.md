#HTTPS Certificate Setup

To be access your visual through PowerBI you need to add a trusted certificate for localhost. This will allow PowerBI to load the visual assets in your browser without a security warning.

##Adding Certificate

* [Windows](CertificateAddWindows.md)
* [OSX](CertificateAddOSX.md)

##Removing Certificate

If you are no longer using the PowerBI Custom Visual CLI tools you should remove the certificate from your system.

* [Windows](CertificateRemoveWindows.md)
* [OSX](CertificateRemoveOSX.md)
