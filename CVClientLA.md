**POWER BI CUSTOM VISUALS – STANDARD VISUALIZATION LICENSE TERMS**

These license terms are an agreement between you and the visualization developer. Please read them. 
They apply to the visualization for Power BI you download from the Public AppSource store, including any updates 
or supplements for the visualization (the “Visualization”), unless the Visualization comes with separate 
terms, in which case those terms apply.  

**BY DOWNLOADING OR USING THE VISUALIZATION, OR ATTEMPTING TO DO ANY OF THESE, YOU 
ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO AND MUST NOT 
DOWNLOAD OR USE THE VISUALIZATION.** 

**The Visualization developer means the entity licensing the Visualization to you, as identified in the 
Public AppSource store.**  

**If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.**

1. **INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.** You may install and use any number of copies of the Visualization 
for use with a product or service that supports the Power BI visual interface.  

2. **INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.**  
**a. Consent for Internet-Based or Wireless Services.** The Visualization connects to computer systems 
over the Internet, which may include via a wireless network. Using the Visualization operates as your 
consent to the transmission of standard device information (including but not limited to technical 
information about your device, system and Visualization software, and peripherals) for internet-based 
or wireless services.  
**b. Misuse of Internet-based Services.** You may not use any Internet-based service in any way that could 
harm it or impair anyone else’s use of it or the wireless network. You may not use the service to try to 
gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.  
3. **SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The Visualization is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights 
to use the Visualization. Visualization developer reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you 
more rights despite this limitation, you may use the Visualization only as expressly permitted in this 
agreement. You may not  
• work around any technical limitations in the Visualization; or 
• reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Visualization, except and only to the extent that 
applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation.  
4. **DOCUMENTATION.** If documentation is provided with the Visualization, you may copy and use the 
documentation for personal reference purposes.  
5. **TECHNOLOGY AND EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** The Visualization may be subject to United States or 
international technology control or export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and 
international export laws and regulations that apply to the technology used or supported by the 
Visualization. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For information on 
Microsoft branded products, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.  
6. **SUPPORT SERVICES.** Microsoft is not responsible for providing support services for the Visualization. If 
Microsoft is the Visualization developer, it may provide support services, but is not obligated to do so 
under this agreement. Contact the Visualization developer to determine what support services are 
available.  
7. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, any applicable Visualization developer privacy policy, and the 
terms for supplements and updates are the entire agreement between you and Visualization developer 
for the Visualization. If Microsoft is the Visualization developer, this agreement does not change the 
terms of your relationship with Microsoft with regard to Power BI, Microsoft Office, the Public AppSource store, or 
any other Microsoft product or service (which is governed by the software license terms that 
accompanied, or terms of use that are associated with, the applicable product or service).  
8. **APPLICABLE LAW.**  
a. **United States. If you acquired the Visualization in the United States, Washington state law governs 
the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of 
laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under 
state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.**
b. **Outside the United States. If you acquired the Visualization in any other country, the laws of that 
country apply.**

9. **LEGAL EFFECT.** This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the 
laws of your state or country. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state 
or country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.  
10. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, (A) THE VISUALIZATION 
IS LICENSED "AS-IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS," AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND YOU BEAR ALL RISK OF USING IT;

THAT THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE; AND (D) VISUALIZATION DEVELOPER AND MICROSOFT 
EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY,

BY LAW, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM THE VISUALIZATION DEVELOPER ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO 
THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE VISUALIZATION OR $1.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. YOU WILL NOT, 
AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO, SEEK TO RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL,

or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
